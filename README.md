# 🌤SimpleWeather is a small SPA I made as a pet project

Hello! This is my first SPA using a combination of React and Redux.\
Features:
- City search.
- Page with an hourly / three-day weather forecast.
- Adding a city to the list of favorites (stored in localStorage).
- The ability to switch the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

In my work I used [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/), [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

### 🐱‍🏍If you want to see a demo go [here](https://keyofevergreen.github.io/SimpleWeather/)!

## How to use

1. You need to register at [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and get an API key (Note that the request has all the checkboxes next to the fields in the tab "API Response Fields").
2. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/keyofevergreen/SimpleWeather.git
```
3. Go to the cloned directory (e.g. `cd SimpleWeather`).
4. Add the API key to the ".env.example" file
5. Run `npm install`.
6. Run `npm start`. The command will start a local live server. Open (http://localhost:3000/SimpleWeather) in your browser, if the tab doesn't open automatically.

### I would be glad to have any code review on your part :)
